# Variable-management - first version

The variable manager allows you to display all the variables of the selected program file. All you have to do is choose the variable and you will get the following information:
  - Its name
  - Its starting value
  - Its type
  - The line number where it is created
  
For the moment this program only works on Python but this is only the first version of the project. Several features will appear later.
